# 💎 Gemstone Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts gemstone prices based on various attributes like carat, cut, color, clarity, etc. This project includes an end-to-end pipeline for data ingestion, transformation, model training, evaluation, and a Flask web application for real-time prediction.

## Project Steps
This project follows a modular, pipeline-driven workflow for building and deploying a machine learning model to predict gemstone prices.

# 1. Data Ingestion
- The raw dataset (gemstone.csv) is read using Pandas.
- The data is split into training and testing sets.
- Both splits are saved as .csv files in the artifacts/ directory for reproducibility.
- This logic is encapsulated inside a custom class-based pipeline (DataIngestion).

# 2. Data Transformation
- A custom ColumnTransformer pipeline is built to preprocess both numeric and categorical features.
# Numeric features:
- Missing values are handled using SimpleImputer(strategy='median').
- Features are standardized using StandardScaler.
# Categorical features:
- Missing values are filled using SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent').
- Categories are encoded using Ordinal Encoding.
- Features are scaled using StandardScaler.
- The entire preprocessing pipeline is saved as a .pkl file for later use during prediction.

# 3. Model Training
- Several regression models are trained with hyperparameter tuning and evaluated on the processed dataset.
- Random Forest was the best performing model
- The trained final model is saved as .pkl file.

# 4. Prediction Pipeline
- The PredictionPipeline class handles:
- Input data transformation using the saved preprocessor.
- Model loading and prediction.
- Input data (from the web app) is converted to a DataFrame internally.
- The pipeline returns the predicted gemstone price to the user.

# 5. Flask Web Application
- A lightweight Flask app is created with a user-friendly interface.
- Users can input gemstone features via a web form.
- On submission, the backend loads the pre-trained model and returns a predicted price.
- Frontend is built with basic HTML/CSS inside the templates/ and static/ folders.

# Result
- Random Forest Regressor was the best model with r2_score of 97
